# **Disclaimer**
This mod is a **client-side** mod.  
If a server bans the use of client-side mods, **do not use this mod**.  
If you choose to use this mod anyway and are banned, I am **not responsible**.  
**Ask server admin/staff** if this mod is allowed before using it.

## AutoFishing Info:
This mod does one simple thing:  
It makes autofishing easier on servers by casting the rod when you interact with a **note block**, as long as your line 
is not already cast.  
This is useful for autofish farms involving a note block to keep the rod from reeling in then 
typically an **iron trapdoor** will briefly block your line of sight, allowing you to cast again.

###  Why?
Sometimes, due to server lag or other reasons, the rod may be used twice when interacting with the iron trapdoor. This 
leaves the rod reeled in, and you're just left hitting a note block for no reason.  

Could I have just altered the design of the farm to avoid this? Probably.  
But I'm lazy and this was a fun little project to learn some mod development.

##### Ending Notes
I have no clue if this works on other versions, I have not tested it, I'm sure I will find out when I try to use it on
other versions. Feel free to try it on other versions and let me know if it works.
